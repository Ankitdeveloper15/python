•    when you are not asking a question do not switch on the mike or camera,( we can avoid participants hearing the tomato vendors voices)
•    enter your name and phone number only when the coordinator asks( otherwise you are confusing the other participants)

from Balkishan to everyone:
I think we are taking too much time for understanding Robotics....rather that how to value a Robotics Co.....we would like to understand more how we can value and what methodology shud be applied
from Bhuvana R to everyone:
Exactly
from HOME to everyone:
From the valuation perspective, do we require this much deep insight about robots?
from sbanka9 to everyone:
The comment by Mr NB is not fair
from Vipul Gosaliya to everyone:
Admin please mute all other than speaker
from Rajesh Kamath to everyone:
Its speaker prerogative
from Vipul Gosaliya to everyone:
then please call him and ask him to do so
from KETAN KATARIA to everyone:
i agree focus should be on Valuation methods along with pros and cons
from sbanka9 to everyone:
we are just requesting to focus on valuation instated of robotics...he said thay he is not expert in robotics anyway...speaker should focus on subject
from mahipal singh negi to everyone:
Robot not.. now VIrus is killling.... valuation also needed virus science
from SONY to everyone:
we need focus on valuation 
from sanjivrathi to everyone:
no comparable listed company , how to arrive at multiple 
from Veena Bade to everyone:
what is the difference between Uipath and RPA?
from RAMJI to everyone:
for uipath, so many rpa comaponies are available
from Sahil Gugnani to everyone:
But most of the new entrants in the market are pre revenue or  in losses , EBITDA  multiple wont hold much ground
from Ankit to everyone:
RPA is robotics process automation
from Ankit to everyone:
and UiPATH is company who uses RPA
from sanjivrathi to everyone:
Berkus is better
from Veena Bade to everyone:
Ok Thanks
from Balkishan to everyone:
i agree....what shud we do for a Loss making startups...in its 1st or 2nd yr of operation...
from CA Tarun Nebhnani to everyone:
can we have access to recording as i missed the starting.
from Kaizad Jehangir to everyone:
Flipkart is in loss since inception. Howeevr its valuation is ever increasing . Reason : perception  
from Balkishan to everyone:
how to value perception....what mathematics have to be applied......
from sanjivrathi to everyone:
exit vlaue
from Nitin Brahma to everyone:
What would be the difference between valuation of a robotic company with turnover of 1000 crores having 10% PBT and a non-robotic company with turnover of 1000 Cores and 10% profit? Will it be same or different?
from deepak to everyone:
Amazon had a similar story...for a very long time it was udner loss. Bezos never promised profits in most of his AGM adresses
from Shreehari to everyone:
possible further investment and when can i exit
from Rajesh Kamath to everyone:
Bigger fool theory I guess...
from Kaizad Jehangir to everyone:
Its a marketing gimmick . even greats  like walmart can be enticed into believing . No science / mathematics . Its communication skill.   
from sanjivrathi to everyone:
till u make money on exit rest doesnt matter
from Sahil Gugnani to everyone:
Approach would depend upon the basis  , if some one is looking for earnings, exiting at a point, partnering in stratergic decision etc and methods would change accordingly
from Mahesh K gupta to everyone:
an entity making losses does not mean that it has no value like flipkart and some industries.  and since value does change with circumstances as Tatas bought Sores and noe the value is at much lower range. Similarly Japanese company bought Ranbaxy and result is known. Some hotels facing same thing like Airlines 
from Mahesh K gupta to everyone:
please read Cores
from deepak to everyone:
its a ll about market share and reaching a monoplistic position...and then behave like a monopoly
from Sahil Gugnani to everyone:
not saying they are valueless but the approach to be adopted shall be different from the conventional ones
from Sahil Gugnani to everyone:
operating matrics & MOAT becomes important here
from Mahesh K gupta to everyone:
